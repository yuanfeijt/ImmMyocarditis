## Data Description
### Data Integration: Batch Effect Correction and Data Integration using scVI
This study utilizes publicly available single-cell sequencing data from mouse models of myocarditis induced by various etiologies to investigate the distinct immune characteristics associated with different causative factors. The data used in this study were sourced from the following publications:<br>
After quality control, approximately 400,000 single cells from myocarditis samples induced by different etiologies were obtained for analysis.
